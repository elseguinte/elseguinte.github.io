&lt;p&gt;If you’re not already aware, on average search engine users overwhelmingly click on the organic results (free results) on Google and Bing, before they click on a sponsor paid ad listing, by a margin of 94 percent to 6 percent.
Se você não estiver ciente, em média de usuários do motor de busca, clique em esmagadoramente nos resultados orgânicos (resultados livres) no Google e Bing, antes que eles cliquem em um patrocinador pago anúncio, por uma margem de 94 por cento a 6 por cento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last 15 years we have worked with hundreds of Australian and international companies in the area of web site promotion and search engine optimisation (SEO) from our base in Sydney. We guarantee that our web promotion services will deliver more enquires and customers to your site. Most consumers find web sites by typing a keyword phrase into one of the major search engines. If your site is correctly optimised for the appropriate keywords it will appear near the top of the search results. The higher your site’s ranking, the more visitors it should receive. Better still, because these visitors chose your keywords themselves, you know they are ideal prospects for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To rank different web sites, each search engine uses a different algorithm, looking at different components of your web site including document title, meta tags, keywords in the URL, keywords in the text, headings in the text, number of pages, and external links into the site. Many web design and media agency companies will use software that promotes your web site, this is NOT always beneficial and can negatively affect your rankings. We always manually optimise your site for relevant phrases and then submit your site to the top search engines and directories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Promotion and SEO Quality Guarantee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a certified web promotion company, we have made customer satisfaction a fundamental priority. Since Search Engine Optimisation is a rapidly evolving, technically complex and often misunderstood field we have taken the initiative of developing the Search Engine Optimisation Quality Guarantee. We explicitly guarantee the following standards of practice on all search engine optimisation projects that we undertake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We optimise web sites for relevant keywords only. We do not use ‘cloaking techniques’ that show search engines and web users different content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We monitor the effectiveness of our optimisation services and provide all clients with a follow up report detailing their site’s rankings with the major search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our primary focus is to improve the search experience for web users by helping search engines find relevant results. Search engines change the algorithms they use to rank web sites frequently and it is not possible to accurately predict future rankings and traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we use techniques that we know work on standard sites and anticipate a significant increase in qualified site traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not just a search engine registration service. We offer a pin-point target marketing programme that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works with you to identify your most relevant keyword phrases.Manually optimises your web site’s key documents using our proven techniques.Offers ongoing web promotion strategies.Guarantees your web rankings will improve.Guarantees your web site’s traffic will increase.
Search engine optimisation is a crucial part of the marketing mix but many websites are not designed to be search engine friendly and are often missing key components that are important for gaining good rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;e-commerce-seo&quot;&gt;E-commerce SEO&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a total solutions business our aim is to help our customers generate more leads, revenue and profitability from their online ecommerce website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using our established and tried services and strategies, these can include:
- SEO = Search Engine Optimization

- ECO = Ecommerce Conversion Optimization
- Ecommerce Website Design&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Projetos: OpenBSD</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;openbsd&quot;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenBSD project produces a freely available, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our goals place emphasis on correctness, security, standardization, and portability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-might-i-want-to-use-openbsd&quot;&gt;Why might I want to use OpenBSD?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New users frequently want to know whether OpenBSD is superior to some other free UNIX-like operating system. That question is largely unanswerable and is the subject of countless (and useless) religious debates. Do not, under any circumstances, ask such a question on an OpenBSD mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OpenBSD runs on many different hardware platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OpenBSD is thought of by many security professionals as the most secure UNIX-like operating system, as the result of a never-ending comprehensive source code security audit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available in source form at no charge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OpenBSD integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for building firewalls and private network services in a distributed environment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OpenBSD benefits from strong ongoing development in many areas, offering opportunities to work with emerging technologies with an international community of programmers and end-users.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OpenBSD attempts to minimize the need for customization and tweaking. For the vast majority of users, OpenBSD “Just Works” on their hardware for their application. Not only is tweaking and customizing rarely needed, it is actively discouraged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, whether OpenBSD is right for you is a question that only you can answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nosso-propsito&quot;&gt;Nosso Propósito&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Projetos: NetBSD</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;netbsd&quot;&gt;NetBSD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NetBSD Project is an international collaborative effort of a large group of people, to produce a freely available and redistributable UNIX-like operating system, NetBSD. In addition to our own work, NetBSD contains a variety of other free software, including 4.4BSD Lite from the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary focuses of the NetBSD project has been to make the base OS highly portable. This has resulted in NetBSD being ported to a large number of hardware platforms. NetBSD is also interoperable, implementing many standard APIs and network protocols, and emulating many other systems’ ABIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NetBSD is distributed in three forms: formal releases, maintenance branches, and NetBSD-current. Formal releases are done periodically and include well-tested binaries, source code, and installation tools. Maintenance branches usually provide bug and security fixes and minor enhancements. NetBSD-current is a nightly distribution of the latest development sources, meant for people who want the absolute latest software, and don’t mind an occasional bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NetBSD is largely supported by users, via Usenet newsgroups, mailing lists, and direct contributions. If you’re having a problem, it’s likely that someone will have seen it before and will be able to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NetBSD(tm) Foundation is a tax exempt, not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation, that devotes itself to the traditional goals and Spirit of the NetBSD Project and owns the trademark of the word “NetBSD”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Projetos:  Manutenção e Suporte mensal</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;maintenance-support&quot;&gt;Maintenance Support&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days most businesses, big and small are time poor. Some customers prefer to maintain their own web sites, whilst others prefer not to. Either way our DSO maintenance and website support services can provide your business with ongoing, reliable and affordable website solutions, delivered in a timely and professional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our maintenance support packages start from just $10 per month and can used to simply update and add content to a news blog, or for adding text and updated changes to your web site. We prefer to tailor make a support maintenance package for you to ensure we cover all areas of your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a small, home-based business or a large scale, corporate or government organisation, we can work with you and agree on a tailored made maintenance support package that’s just right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before selecting a plan, we suggest you take a look at your web site and forecast how often you will need to make changes and or add new pages on average per month and or need support and help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSO Budget Maintenance Plan – $15 per month + gst – Payable annually upfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving you piece of mind that your website is being regularly updated, checked for problems, and small issues are covered; without a hitch and amortised over the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2 hours website maintenance per month to be applied to simple content and functionality changes, advice, and general support. Does NOT include new graphic design, new pages or programming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guaranteed 8 business hours response time on all change and support requests provided as part of this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSO Business Maintenance Plan – $55 per month + gst – Payable annually upfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When pro-actively engaging with your customers is paramount for your business, this plan will ensure that you are communicating outwardly each and every month and ensuring your web site is updated and maintained with urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5 hours website maintenance per month to be applied to simple content and functionality changes, advice, and general support. Includes up to one new page with matching web site graphic design and programming per month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guaranteed 8 business hours response time on all change and support requests provided as part of this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSO Lite Maintenance Plan – $25 per month + gst – Payable annually upfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your business evolves and changes as the market changes and customer demands change. The Lite plan ensures that your website evolves with your business, and continues to present you in an up-to-date and professional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3 hours website maintenance per month to be applied to simple content and functionality changes, advice, and general support. Does NOT include new graphic design, new pages or programming.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Projetos:  Manutenção e Suporte mensal</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;maintenance-support&quot;&gt;Maintenance Support&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days most businesses, big and small are time poor. Some customers prefer to maintain their own web sites, whilst others prefer not to. Either way our DSO maintenance and website support services can provide your business with ongoing, reliable and affordable website solutions, delivered in a timely and professional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our maintenance support packages start from just $10 per month and can used to simply update and add content to a news blog, or for adding text and updated changes to your web site. We prefer to tailor make a support maintenance package for you to ensure we cover all areas of your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a small, home-based business or a large scale, corporate or government organisation, we can work with you and agree on a tailored made maintenance support package that’s just right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before selecting a plan, we suggest you take a look at your web site and forecast how often you will need to make changes and or add new pages on average per month and or need support and help.&lt;/p&gt;
