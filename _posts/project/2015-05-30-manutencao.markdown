####Maintenance Support
These days most businesses, big and small are time poor. Some customers prefer to maintain their own web sites, whilst others prefer not to. Either way our DSO maintenance and website support services can provide your business with ongoing, reliable and affordable website solutions, delivered in a timely and professional manner.

Our maintenance support packages start from just $10 per month and can used to simply update and add content to a news blog, or for adding text and updated changes to your web site. We prefer to tailor make a support maintenance package for you to ensure we cover all areas of your requirements.

Whether you’re a small, home-based business or a large scale, corporate or government organisation, we can work with you and agree on a tailored made maintenance support package that’s just right for you.

Before selecting a plan, we suggest you take a look at your web site and forecast how often you will need to make changes and or add new pages on average per month and or need support and help.
